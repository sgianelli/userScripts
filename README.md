# User Scripts

Place to put random greasemonkey-style userscripts to make my life easier.

## github-vscode.user.js

This is a slap'n'dash plugin that makes my life on a computer where I'm pretty much only working within one repo. This could be improved to support any repo on your system but that took effort.

- Set the BASE_PATH to where your repo lives
- Install with something like Greasemonkey (FireFox) or Tampermonkey (Chrome)
